This repository ontains  a data set of ten thousand actions of 22 clients sorted by the time it happended.
Among those actions are winning a deal and some of the other actions of a client will lead to winning a deal.


questions are as below:
What is the probability that client "853a7b24-e6df-494f-9d7f-a7b7330244ec" will have a "WonDeal" action in the future?
What would be the best "System Activity" we could do to increase that probability?

I asnswered those questions using XGBoost and bidirectional LSTM.
